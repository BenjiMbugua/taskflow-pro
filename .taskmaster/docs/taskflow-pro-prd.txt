#### 11.2 Database Schema Design
**Core Entities**:
- Users (authentication, preferences, settings)
- Projects (workspaces, color themes, sharing permissions)
- Tasks (hierarchical with parent-child relationships)
- PomodoroSessions (time tracking, interruptions, notes)
- Analytics (aggregated productivity metrics)
- Integrations (calendar sync, webhook configurations)

**Key Relationships**:
- User → Projects (one-to-many)
- Project → Tasks (one-to-many with hierarchy)
- Task → PomodoroSessions (one-to-many)
- User → Analytics (one-to-many, time-series data)

#### 11.3 Coolify Deployment Configuration
**Environment Variables**:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
REDIS_URL=redis://...
WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
```

**Resource Requirements**:
- CPU: 1-2 cores for small teams, 4+ for enterprise
- RAM: 2GB minimum, 8GB recommended for larger datasets
- Storage: 20GB base + 1GB per 1000 active users
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+ with 2GB RAM allocation

#### 11.4 Component Architecture with shadcn/ui

**Theme Implementation**:
Your custom theme provides a sophisticated color system using OKLCH color space for better perceptual uniformity and accessibility. Key features include:

- **Color Palette**: 50+ semantic color tokens with perfect light/dark mode variants
- **Typography**: System font stacks (sans, serif, mono) for optimal cross-platform rendering
- **Elevation**: 8-level shadow system from 2xs to 2xl for depth hierarchy
- **Sidebar Components**: Dedicated theming for navigation with accent colors
- **Chart Colors**: 5 coordinated chart colors for data visualization consistency

**Core Components with Theme Integration**:
- **TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm**: Utilizing card, muted, and accent colors for task states
- **PomodoroTimer, TimerControls**: Primary colors for active states, destructive for urgent timers
- **Dashboard, AnalyticsChart**: Chart color palette for consistent data visualization
- **ProjectSidebar, Navigation**: Dedicated sidebar color tokens for navigation hierarchy
- **SettingsPanel, ThemeSelector**: Seamless theme switching with CSS custom properties

**Tailwind v4 Configuration**:
```css
/* Your theme will be integrated into tailwind.config.ts */
@theme inline {
  /* Your existing color tokens */
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-primary: var(--primary);
  /* ... all your theme variables */
}
```

**Component Theming Strategy**:
- Task priority levels mapped to semantic colors (destructive for urgent, primary for high)
- Pomodoro timer states using primary/secondary color progression
- Analytics charts leveraging the 5-color chart palette
- Sidebar navigation using dedicated sidebar color tokens
- Form inputs and interactive elements using ring and accent colors
